# Design and Physical Implementation of a Smart Camera Slider Using Reinforcement Learning

The camera slider controller is a deep Q-network (DQN) agent, and its goal is to collectively follow and centralize human faces in the camera frame. The agent can be trained on pre-processed videos with detected faces coordinates. The DQN agent controls three stepper motors that rotate to operate the camera slider with three degrees of freedom. An image of the camera slider prototype can be seen below.
